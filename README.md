## Introduction

This project aims to replicate and simulate the decomposition methods proposed for solving dynamic room allocation problems in hotel revenue management. The focus is on how to allocate rooms efficiently when customers request stays over multiple days, including advance bookings and potential stay-over extensions.

The original paper proposes two key decomposition strategies:

- **Day-based decomposition**: Approximates the complex network model by breaking it down into independent daily subproblems.
- **Pair-based decomposition**: Focuses on check-in/check-out pairs, especially effective when considering stay-over requests.

## Purpose

This repository is built for research and academic purposes, providing a foundation for further exploration, testing, or extension of hotel revenue management models under dynamic, multi-day demand conditions.
